NOMENCLATURE
In the Designing Earthquake Detector Alarm with Seismic Graph using Accelerometer
and Arduino Mechanism” nomenclature refers to the methodical naming scheme used to
categorize and identify the many parts, procedures, and technologies used in the design. This
includes standardizing language for:
• Arduino Uno: A microcontroller board used to control the different parts of the
framework, including sensors and actuators.
• ADXL335: An accelerometer with three axes for measuring acceleration is the
ADXL335.
• Threshold-Based Detection: The process of identifying events by comparing observed
values to predetermined thresholds is known as threshold-based detection..
• Real-time Seismic Data Visualization: Visualizing seismic data in real time, usually
in a graphical manner, is known as real-time seismic data visualization.
Establishing a coherent and predictable classification system is fundamental for empowering
powerful correspondence, documentation, and perception among partners associated with the
task's plan, improvement, and organization stages. It guarantees exact distinguishing proof and
referring to of different venture components, accordingly working with consistent coordinated
effort and reconciliation towards the objective of helping outwardly weakened people with
route.
