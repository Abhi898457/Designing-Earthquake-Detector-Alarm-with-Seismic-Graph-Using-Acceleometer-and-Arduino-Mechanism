ABSTRACT
Early warning systems are essential for reducing the impact of earthquakes, which pose a
serious risk to property and human life. An ADXL335 accelerometer is used in this project's
Arduino-based earthquake detection system to identify seismic activity, sound an alert, and
graphically display real time seismic data on an LED screen.
The three axes (X, Y, and Z) are used by the ADXL335 accelerometer to measure acceleration.
The analog impulses from the accelerometer are processed by the Arduino microcontroller and
transformed into digital information. When the recorded acceleration exceeds a predetermined
threshold, the system detects seismic events using threshold-based detection.
The system's capacity to visualize seismic data in real time is one of its primary features.
Acceleration numbers for each axis are graphically displayed on the LCD panel. This graphic
provides information on the nature and magnitude of the seismic activity.
The system is made to be flexible, inexpensive, and simple to use. To satisfy specific
requirements, users can modify alarm settings and sensitivity limits. In earthquake-prone areas,
the system seeks to improve safety and readiness by providing timely alerts and useful visual
feedback.
