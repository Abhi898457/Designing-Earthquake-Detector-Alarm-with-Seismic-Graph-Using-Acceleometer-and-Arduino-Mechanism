CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE SURVEY
Arduino-Powered Frameworks for Tremor Identification
Numerous tests and experiments have demonstrated the ability of Arduino-based frameworks
to recognize earthquakes. These frameworks provide flexible, customizable, and cost-effective
solutions for seismic observation.
2.1. Fundamental Components and Accelerometer Method:
2.1.1. The key sensor for identifying seismic vibrations is the accelerometer.
Accelerometers that are often used include:
2.1.2. ADXL335: Suitable for low-power applications, it provides straightforward
results for three-hub estimations.
2.1.3. Microcontroller: Due to their simplicity, affordability, and compatibility with
many sensors, the Arduino Uno and Nano are widely used.
2.1.4. Simple indicators are produced by the accelerometer in comparison to seismic
vibrations.
2.1.5. The Arduino's Simple to-Computerized Converter (ADC) transforms these
indicators into advanced values.
2.2. Advantages Mainly:
2.2.1. Finding Research Gaps: A thorough analysis aids in pointing out
shortcomings in the accuracy, dependability, or affordability of the seismic
detection systems in use today. Finding these gaps is crucial to creating a
stronger solution.
