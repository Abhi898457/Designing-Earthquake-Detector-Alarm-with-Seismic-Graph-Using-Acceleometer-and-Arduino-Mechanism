CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Background and Motivation
Tectonic plate movements or human activity can generate earthquakes, which damage
infrastructure and human lives. This project uses an Arduino and accelerometer to create an
affordable earthquake detection system. It improves safety in resource-constrained,
earthquake-prone environments like homes and schools by guaranteeing precise seismic
activity detection, real-time monitoring, and early warnings through vibration sensors.
Unpredictable natural disasters like earthquakes have the potential to seriously harm
infrastructure and destroy lives. Early detection systems give people and communities vital
time to take preventative action. This project uses an Arduino microcontroller and an
ADXL335 accelerometer to create an earthquake detection system that is both economical
and efficient.
These analog signals are processed by a microcontroller, which then transforms them into
digital data and examines it to find seismic The tiny, low-power, three-axis ADXL335
accelerometer measures acceleration along the X, Y, and Z axes. The accelerometer detects
variations in acceleration caused by ground vibrations during an earthquake.

The system's real-time seismic graph, which is shown on an LCD screen, is one of its best
features. Users can evaluate the magnitude of the earthquake by using this graphic
representation, which offers insights into the patterns and intensity of seismic activity.
A threshold-based system is the foundation of the detecting process. An alarm is triggered by
the system when acceleration beyond a predetermined threshold due to seismic activity.
Depending on the needs of the user, the alarm might be as basic as a buzzer or as sophisticated
as email or SMS alerts.
This project offers a dependable and reasonably priced early earthquake detection method by
fusing powerful hardware with effective software. Because of its adaptable design, it may be
used for a variety of purposes, making it a useful tool for improving safety and readiness in
seismically active places.
